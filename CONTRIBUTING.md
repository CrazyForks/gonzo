* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes (`make test`)
5. Make sure your code follows the existing style (`make fmt vet`)
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/control-theory/gonzo.git
   cd gonzo
   ```

2. **Install Go 1.21 or higher**
   ```bash
   # Check your Go version
   go version
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   make deps
   ```

4. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

5. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Before committing:

1. **Format your code**
   ```bash
   make fmt
   ```

2. **Run the linter**
   ```bash
   make vet
   ```

3. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

4. **Build to ensure it compiles**
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

Or run all at once:
```bash
make dev
```

### Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Testing

* Write tests for new functionality
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Include both unit tests and integration tests where appropriate
* Test with different log formats (JSON, OTLP, plain text)

### Documentation

* Update the README.md if you change functionality
* Update the USAGE_GUIDE.md for new features
* Comment your code where necessary
* Update help text for new CLI flags
